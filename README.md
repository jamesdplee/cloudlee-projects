# cloudlee-projects

Welcome to the cloudlee projects repo. Here you can find a collection of freely available mini projects for Azure, to help you get more hands-on skills. This repo will keep growing over time. Find a list of the projects at the [bottom of this page](/README.md#video-guided-mini-projects-videos-linked-inside-and-on-youtube).

You can access these mini projects in two ways:

- Freely available right here with instructions & diagrams
- As part of [https://learn.cloudlee.io](https://learn.cloudlee.io) courses, with supporting lessons and videos

I'll also be including some videos available for free for these projects, with thanks to those of you who buy my paid content to support this.

# What can you do?

These mini projects will cover a range of topics like administration tasks, architecture evolution, securing existing solutions, troubleshooting broken/incomplete configuration, and more. Many different topics and tasks.

You will be able to:

- Use step-by-step instructions to help you get experience, or
- Implement the project requirements using included goals without following instructions

# How the projects work

Each mini project has the following structure:

- Most include a `Click to Deploy` template so you can click a button to get project resources up and running in your own Azure subscription fast (so you can focus on learning/building)

- `01_LABSETUP` includes resources that will help get things running, and sometimes includes completed files/assets (to help if you want to check your work or skip to different stages)

- `02_LABINSTRUCTIONS` for text-bassed instructions and architecture diagrams

You won't really need to worry too much about the structure, as the instructions will guide you through the process and include links/diagrams to everything you need.

A full range of guided videos are available in my courses, which you can find at both [https://learn.cloudlee.io](https://learn.cloudlee.io) and [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io).
